# CMPM-163-HW1-Introduction-to-Shaders
Consists of HW1 A,B,C

HW1A: Introduces concepts of shaders, lights, and Unity Game Objects
HW1B: Takes an image and applies a sharpen matrix to each texel. The effect can be seen when the image is linearly interpolated at a mid to high mix. Mix increases with horizontal mouse position. Left Click increases intensity while Right Click Decreases intensity. Full screen recommended.
HW1C: It is the Game Of Life algorithm except 2 live neighbors of a dead cell will revive the dead cell, and the colors are different. May not work on WebGL.
